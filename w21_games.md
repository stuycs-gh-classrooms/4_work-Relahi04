# Breakout/ Arkanoid
Purpose: The purpose is to destroy the blocks which is done when a ball touches it. If the user is unable to catch the ball and the ball falls, then youse loose. 

Elements controlled by the player: The location of the paddle is controlled by the user. 

Elements controlled by the coputer: The degree of rotation and velocity of the ball is controlled by the computer. 

Player control their element: The player moves the mouse to control the paddle. 

How do the non-player controlled elements behave: The degree of rotation is based on where the ball bounces and it's usually unpredictable until it's falling. The random items that fall after certain boxes are hit are also controlled by the computer; sometimes those items are helpful, othertimees it might lead to death. 

Classes: classes: Paddle, Ball, Blocks;  

Arrays: I would use an array to create the blocks. I'd use 2d array programmed similar to w20_fors2d to do this.
